We introduce the **task** of **Text-based Person Anomaly Search**, 
which aims to locate pedestrians engaged in both routine and anomalous 
activities using natural language descriptions. Given the lack of a 
**dataset** in this field, we construct the **P**edestrian **A**nomaly 
**B**ehavior (**PAB**) benchmark, featuring **1, 013, 605** synthesized 
and **1, 978** real-world image-text pairs with a broad spectrum of 
actions and anomalies.

This is the comparison of our proposed task, i.e., Text-based Person Anomaly Search (right) vs. Traditional Text-Based Person
Search (left).

We propose a **C**ross-**M**odal **P**ose-aware (**CMP**) framework that 
integrates human pose patterns with identity-based hard negative pair 
sampling to enhance the discrimination between normal and anomalous behaviors. 
This framework leverages structural information from human poses 
to improve the understanding of pedestrian activities, 
leading to better retrieval performance.

Extensive experiments on the PAB benchmark show that synthetic training data 
effectively facilitates fine-grained behavior retrieval in real-world 
test sets. Our pose-aware method arrives at 84.93% recall@1 accuracy, 
surpassing other competitive methods.

## PAB
PAB leverages generative models to generate a large-scale dataset including 
1𝑀 image-text pairs. Each image-text pair in PAB is annotated with 
action and scene attribute, indicating that PAB is not only effective 
for Text-based Person Anomaly Search, but also supports 
future attribute recognition tasks like action or scene classification.
The dataset is released at 
[OneDrive](https://1drv.ms/f/c/afc02d7952f9b34d/Epb3qCEwsMJOjYIx-sMm_rkBbZfyiD8I-bRmLp0X-rT1vQ?e=7gyGco) 
& [Baidu Yun](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1gqY6DuTL-EStXlH0dz05ng) [mdjb].

**Note that PAB can only be used for research, any commercial usage is forbidden.**

This is the comparison between PAB and existing text-based pedestrian search and video anomaly detection datasets in terms of data quality and
quantity.

## Usage

### Install Requirements

We use 4 NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 GPUs (24G) for training and evaluation.

Clone the repo:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/Shuyu-XJTU/CMP.git
cd CMP
```
Create conda environment and install dependencies:

```sh
conda create -n cmp python=3.10
conda activate cmp
# Ensure torch >= 2.0.0 and install torch based on CUDA Version
# For example, if CUDA Version is 11.8, install torch 2.2.0:
pip install torch==2.2.0 torchvision==0.17.0 torchaudio==2.2.0 --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

For the first time you use wordnet
```
python
>>> import nltk
>>> nltk.download('wordnet')
```

### Parameter Initialization

Download pre-trained models for parameter initialization:

Initializing parameters from [X-VLM (16M)](https://github.com/zengyan-97/x-vlm):
